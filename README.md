## Project Overview
This project was developed during my service as a Public Service Officer at the **Suwon Immigration Office (Ministry of Justice)**. It aims to efficiently distribute digital media to participants of citizenship ceremonies through a secure, localized system.

### Key Problems Solved
- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminated the need for recurring subscription fees to commercial QR generation services by implementing an in-house solution.
- **Privacy & Security**: Developed a **standalone tool** that operates entirely on local hardware, ensuring 100% compliance with government security protocols and preventing unauthorized data leaks to external servers.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Digitized the manual, paper-based attendee tracking and distribution process, significantly reducing administrative overhead and wait times.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Library**: Open-source QR Code algorithm (qrcode.js)
